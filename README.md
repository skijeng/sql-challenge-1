# sql-challenge-1

Process:

I started by creating a table for each CSV file in the project files folder; matching the column names and data types (int, varchar, and var) where appropriate. I then used the import/export tool to import the csv files into the tables. The properties for each table and column are found in the tables folder. Afterwards, I joined them into a joined table and saved it as 'joinedtables' and did my analysis from there. Each analysis was saved as a View file, then saved as a CSV; which can be found in the analysis folder. I used the postgres ERD function to build the ERD diagram by matching each table to their respective matching column names. This diagram allowed for quicker table joins when moing to that section of the process.

The answers to each analysis question can be found in the analysis folder. Each question asks for a list which I saved as a CSV file for each.

I was able to complete this project using the lecture videos along with trial and error.
